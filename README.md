# sc-knapsack-problem

How many different combination sets can you fit an array of different weights into a bag of limited capacity?

```
let items be an array of different Weights
let cap be the capacity of the bag

items = [3, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4]
cap = 6

possible combinations: {}, {3}, {1}, {3, 1}, {6], {5}, {1, 5}, {4}, {1, 4}
return 9
```
